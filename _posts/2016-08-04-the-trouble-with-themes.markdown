While the main goal for the day was to get the site up and running, it would be even better to have a working style. I've been struggling with getting the default minima theme to work on the live github.io site, and between strange scss import issues and no working _sass folder in the source directory, I'm beginning more and more tempted to restart with a strong -src repo. I may just have to wait until tomorrow to figure all of this out.
