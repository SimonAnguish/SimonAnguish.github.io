While I've never had a blog system set up, I figured it would be a good motivator for me to work harder towards actual projects. I hope to post an update on this site every day, with the exception of weekends, with news about what I've been working on.

I would also like to try and post one update a week with my thoughts about things that are in the news. That should make me pay more attention to what's going on in the world.
