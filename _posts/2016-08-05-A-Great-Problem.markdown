In my free time I'm the dungeon master for a group of friends and former coworkers, as well as my girlfriend. Usually we meet on Saturday evenings to play, so that I can prepare while Jenn is at work, and it's over all a lot of fun. Today however, due to some scheduling issues, we will be playing as soon as I leave work. 2 of the 3 players have had minimal experience with DnD and the other one was a dungeon master for several years, but wanted to a turn playing the game as a character. Here's an excerpt of the adventure that everyone will be playing through today:

> The group breaks out of this trance, and sees a lesser angel before them, warning them that soon the world will break out into total war, evil vs evil, with humanity stuck in the middle. They are given a task to choose, north or south, and fight one of the evils. They are given one night to make their decision, and in the morning they will set out towards their choice. They were told that their rooms at the local in have been paid for, and that they have been allowed as much ale and food as they would like. They are allowed to ask a handful of questions before the angel leaves. Time unfreezes and the priest is concerned about the ground shaking, and says that the group should leave the town. They are told to go east, towards Four Corners, as they are being seen as harbingers of doom. They stay at the inn at the edge of town along the road, and mull over their decision.

I try to keep the fighting to a minimum, as I think puzzles provide a much more interesting experience, and really encourage the full exploration of the dungeons. I'm also a fan of giving the players hard moral choices, but sometimes I'm worried that I'm pushing the group more towards what I would do, as opposed to letting them make their own decisions. The next dozen or so sessions will revolve around the group fighting one of two evils, that they are allowed to choose. I really want a lot of it to be player decided, so I'm going to structure the fights in mostly the same way, and just roll with it.

Yesterday, I meant to make one post before leaving work about my issues I've been having the Jekyll themes. I don't remember what happened, but I may have accidentally deleted it. It may also be in a different branch, which will make me feel fairly stupid. I also forgot to push my changes last night, so nothing I've done has been published. I need to remember to make a post layout, and figure out why my styling isn't staying between layouts.

This weekend I will try to do my first post about tech news, but it may have to wait until early next week. While I don't have a whole lot of work, Jenn is going out of town for a few days, and I'll be trying to distract myself as much as possible with other things. I also have no idea what I would want to write about.
