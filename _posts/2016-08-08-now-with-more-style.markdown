It may be a small change, but I'm so happy that this is finally starting to look like a real blog. It can definitely use some more color (I'll have material design to thank for that later), but having this list is a very nice place to put all of my thoughts. Next up will probably be to have a form to write blog posts, but I'm honestly enjoying a lot of the Jekyll markdown formatting.

One thing I'm worried about is the blog looking empty. Having the localhost open on the other side of the screen just shows a blank page with the text in the center, and I just feel like it needs more. I've never had a blog before, so while this might be common, it would be nice to have something with a little more going on. The main point is to have people want to read your text, but I feel like unless I start writing pages of text a day it'll continue to look blank. We'll see once we get color in here.
