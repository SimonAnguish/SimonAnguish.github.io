Finally, I have a site that I'm proud of. The mdl CDN makes everything look instantly 10x better. While there are certain aspects of the css framework that I think could use a little more work (some of the text doesn't transfer over great), it's just so easy to fix. After changing the styling on the dates of the post, the tags, and adding the links in the nav to other sections of my site, I think I'm finally in a place where I'm happy to show this off. I probably won't post too many more thoughts on the site itself, since there really won't be much more I need to work on after I have the post and page layouts fully fleshed out.

A few days ago University of Maryland researchers created the first reprogrammable quantum computer. I'm really impressed with that, mostly since previously we've onyl had non-reprogrammable ones. The fact that they can be in a state of being positively charged, negatively charged, and in a state of superposition, where they're both, is amazing. We've basically increased our processing power exponentially, which is awesome. I honestly wish I knew more about this kind of stuff, but I guess that's what this blog is for.

I'm excited to take a vacation for the first time in about a year. While it's the first time I'll be taking a vacation away from work, I am more than happy to have the time off. We've been working hard at work in order to get the websites live before classes start, though that might not happen.

I'll be gone from Monday the 15th to Wednesday the 17th, and Jenn and I will be visiting Old Orchard Beach in Maine. A lot of why I wanted this was to take some time away from work and stress, but I've also never been to the Atlantic Ocean. I figure spending some time with Jenn, maybe visiting Portland, and just generally hanging out on the beach will do me a lot of good. I'll be able to use a lot of the photos that I get from the trip on the blog, and it might help me really narrow in what I want to do post-grad (things are already happening on that front, but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. I'll make a post as soon as something happens there).

I feel like a lot of my posts are lacking because I don't get much of a chance to do things during the day (besides work). I have a pretty low key life, but I'd like to do a lot more, especialyl on the weekends. Maybe this will also help me to actually pay attention to things, but I just feel like I'm not the best writer.
