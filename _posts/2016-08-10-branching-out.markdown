Today I started work on my first real learning experience in a long time. I'm studying for the inevitable interviews I'll have to do in the next few months where they will ask me about different algorithm designs, efficiency, best practices, and more. Realizing this, I also realized that I haven't coded an algorithm in over 2 months. Therefore, I decided now would be a good time to go down the list of algorithms everyone should know:

- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Breadth-First traversal of graphs and trees
- Dijkstra's w/ fibonacci heap
- Kruskal's w/ union find by rank
- deterministic quick select
- polymorphic type inference
- 2D voronoi diagram generation
- 2D convex hull generation
- Knapsack and other DP problems
- Ford-Fulkerson

Thankfull, I've done some of these for class before, so they shouldn't be too hard to redo. I would absolutely love to rework them though, knowing more about how to code than I did when I wrote them.

Some of these I've never heard of before, including the 2D diagram and hull generation algorithms, polymorphic type inference, and deterministic quick select. This is exactly why I am working on this, though: having an audience, even just an imaginary one, means that I'm expected to actually produce content and push myself. Sure, vacation photos and talking about my life are interesting, but they don't further my learning. This will let me continue to learn even after I graduate, and going over vacation and in my free time.

Jenn gets home from Maine today, and she's coming over once she gets back to town. We're going to hopefully plan out our menu for Monday-Wednesday of next week tonight, and then we'll go grocery shopping for everything on Friday after work. I'm so thankful that my boss wants me to have a vacation, since otherwise I think I'd go insane. The one interesting part of all of this is that the office will only have two people in it for the first half of next week, meaning that if something goes wrong, things will absolutely go wrong. Fingers crossed.
