I haven't written a post in a while, and I'm putting most of the blame on classes coming back. Hopefully I'll be able to spend more time now working on blog posts and developing new projects, since I'll be using it as a way to develop my skills. A lack of work means I can spend more time working on projects that I've been meaning to finish for a long time.
