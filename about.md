## About Me
I am a soon to be graduate from the University of Vermont with a degree in Computer Science. This is where I have blog posts and information about projects.

### Current Projects
I have a hanful of projects currently being worked on, but this is where I put the ones I am most proud of.

[PAUL](https://simonanguish.github.io/Bedroom-Project/): PAUL is my <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>utomated <b>U</b>tilities <b>L</b>ibrary, meant to help with automation and memory. This is my pet project, so a lot of the work I am doing with it will be slow, as I work around the rest of my schedule.
