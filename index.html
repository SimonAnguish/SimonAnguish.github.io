                <p>I host a weekly Early Morning Indie Games stream every Saturday morning from 9-12:30. My goal is to discover new games from smaller development studios that need more exposure. I plan to occasionally stream larger, multiplayer games with friends on a semi-regularly evening schedule.</p>

                <p>One of my interests outside of software development is video editing. I aim to produce at least one video per week, consisting of either a gameplay review of the Indie games explored on my regular Saturday streams, funny moments from other games played with friends, or occasional video projects of non Video Game content.</p>
