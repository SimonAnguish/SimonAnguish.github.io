# I'm Simon Anguish

I'm originally from Ontario, Canada, and moved to Vermont when I was 5 years old. I attended the
University of Vermont, studying Computer Science and and minoring in Mathematics. Since graduating
in the Spring of 2017, I've been working as a Software Developer at (Logic Supply,
Inc.)[https://www.logicsupply.com/].

# I Like Food

For two summers after graduating from High School, I worked as a Dishwasher, Server, Line Cook, and
Prep Cook at 3 Squares Cafe in Vergennes, Vermont. Since then, I've always tried to experiment with
my food, trying new recipes and new restaurants.

# I Like Beer

Homebrewing has been a passion of mine for a few years, and I've used my experience and creativity
in coming up with some crazy brews, such as:

* A Hot Toddy inspires English Ale
* A Soured Hefeweizen w/ Brett. Lambicus
* A Cinnamon Gose (a surprisingly crisp fall drink)

I've also dipped my toes into other fermented foods and drinks, such as Cider, Mead, Kombucha, and
Saurkraut.
